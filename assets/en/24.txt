1: When he is frightened in sleep or becomes restless or wakes up
suddenly from sleep, he must make this supplication:

ar: أَعُوذُ بِكَلِمَاتِ اللَّهِ التَّامَّاتِ مِنْ غَضَبِهِ وَعِقَابِهِ وَشَرِّ عِبَادِهِ وَمِنْ هَمَزَاتِ الشَّيَاطِينِ وَأَنْ يَحْضُرُونِ

"I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from His wrath and His punishment and the mischief of His slaves and from the whispers of the devils and that they come near me."

It was with Sayyidina Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al-Aas that he taught his children to repeat this supplication but those who were too young for that were made to wear an amulet on which he wrote these words.
ref:(Abu Dawood 3893, Tirmidhi 3528, Haakim 2010, as narrated by Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn Al-Aas R.A.)

2:

ar: أَعُوْذُ بِکَلِمَاتِ اللّٰهِ التَّآمَّاتِ الَّتِيْ لَا يُجَاوِزُ هُنَّ بَرٌّ وَّلَا فَاجِرٌ مِّنْ شَرِّ مَا يَنْزِلُ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ وَمَا يَعْرُجُ فِيِهَا وَمِنْ شَرِّ مَا ذَرَأَ فِي الْاَرْضِ وَمَا يَخْرُجُ مِنْهَا وَمِنْ شَرِّ فِتَنِ الَّيْلِ وفِتَنِ النَّهَارِ وَمِنْ شَرِّ طَوَارِقِ الَّيْلِ والنَّهَارِ اِلَّا طَارِقًا يَطْرُقُ بِخَيْرٍ يَّارَحْمٰنُ

"I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah, which neither pious nor wicked people can exceed, from the evil that may descend from the heaven or rise up to it, and from the evil that grows within the earth or sprouts from it, and from the evil of the trial of the night and the trial of the day, and from the evil of these coming by night or by day except the comer who comes with good, O Rahman!"
ref: (Tabarani in Kabeer(Urdu) 3746, narrator Khalid Ibn Waheed)
