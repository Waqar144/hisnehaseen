Supplication is accepted at auspicious places. Hassan Basri
had written to the people of Makkah that supplication is accepted at
Makkah at fifteen places:
---
1: While circumambulating the Ka'bah.
---
2: While clinging to the Multazam (the portion between the Black stone and the door of the Ka'bah).
---
3: Under the meezab (it is a drain pipe on the roof of the Ka'bah to spill water from it into the Hateem. It is also called meezab rahmat).
---
4: Inside the Ka'bah.
---
5: Near Zamzam
---
6: On the Safa.
---
7: On the Marwah.
---
8: Between Safa and Marwah while performing the Sa'ee.
---
9: Behind the Maqaam (station of) Ibrahim 3&2 .
---
10: At Arafah.
---
11: At Muzdalifah.
---
12: At Mina.
---
13,14,15: Near the three Jamaraat
---
The compiler then writes, "If supplication is not granted near the Prophet ï·º (meaning his Rawdah or shrine) then where will it be granted?" (So, when you go there to offer Salaam, remember to make a supplication.)

Mulla Ali Qari has written that the places where supplication is accepted at Makkah are not just fifteen. It is also approved at Rukn Yamani and between it and the Hajr Aswad (Black stone). Also, Dar Arqam, the cave Thaur and the cave Hira are places where supplication is accepted.)

Apart from Hassan Busri's letter, there is also a Hadith musalsal through the people of Makkah about approved supplication at Multazam.
