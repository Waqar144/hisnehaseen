1: Allah's Messenger said, "When one knows that his supplication is granted, like recovery for illness or safe return from journey, then what prevents him from saying:

ar: اَلْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ الَّذِيْ بِعِزَّتِهٖ وَجَلَالِهٖ تَتِمُّ الصَّالِحَاتُ
"All praise is for Allah by virtue of whose Might and Majesty all pious tasks come to a conclusion."
