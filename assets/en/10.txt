1: (Prayer is granted if made by them) To pray by virtue of Allah's Names is a means of acceptance of supplication. The compiler has then written down some more invocations and Zikr which the Ahadith describe as means of acceptance of supplication.
1: He heard a man say يا ذالجلال والاكرام (o Lord of Majesty and splendour.) So, he said, "It has been decided to accept your supplication,
so, go ahead, make your petition?"

(Tirmidhi as narrated by Mu'adh)

2: He who says يااَرحَمَ الرَّاحِمِين (O the Most Merciful of those who show mercy!) will have an angel appointed for him. Thus, if anyone says
it three times then the angel says to him, "The Arhamar Rahimeen has turned towards you, so ask Him for what you want."

(Haakim, as narrated by Abu Umamah.)

According to another Hadith, the Prophet passed by a man who was saying يااَرحَمَ الرَّاحِمِين. He said to the man, "Make your request, for, Allah has looked at you with mercy".
(Haakim, as narrated by Anas.)

3: If anyone asks Allah three times for paradise, paradise says, "O Allah admit him to paradise. "And if anyone seeks refuge from Hell three times then Hell says, "O Allah, give him protection from Hell."
(Tirmidhi, Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, Ibn Hibban, Haakim, as narrated by Anas)

4: If anyone makes supplication by virtue of these five expressions
then Allah will let him have whatever He asks of Allah. They are:
ar: لَا إلَهَ إلاَّ اللَّهُ
There is no God but Allah.

ar: الله أكبر
Allah is the Greatest.

ar: لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ
There is no God but Allah, the one, He has no partner. The kingdom
belongs to Him, praise is for Him and He is over everything capable.

ar: لَا إله إلا اللهُ ، وَلاحَولَ وَلَاقُوَّة إلا بِاللهِ
There is no power and no might save with Allah
(Tabarani in Al-Kabeer and Al-Awsat.)
