1:
ar: اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ خَيْرَ الْمَوْلَجِ وَخَيْرَ الْمَخْرَج، بِسْمِ اللَّهِ وَلَجْنَا وَبِسْمِ اللَّهِ خَرَجْنَا وَعَلَى اللَّهِ رَبِّنَا تَوَكَّلْنَا

"O Allah! I ask you for the good of coming in and the good of going out. In the name of Allah we enter and in the name of Allah we go out. In Allah, our Lord, we trust."
Then greet the members of the household.
(Abu Dawood 5096, narrated by Abu Maalik Ash'ari)

Sayyidina Jabir reported that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said, "when a man enters his house and mentions Allah and again while he has his meals, the devil tells his colleagues, ‘Neither can you stay overnight here nor can you have anything from their meals.’ But, if he does not mention Allah on entering the home then the devil tells his colleagues, ‘you have found an opportunity to stay here overnight.' And if Allah's name was not mentioned while eating then the devil says, ‘you also have a meal here.'

(Muslim 2018, Abu Dawood 3765, Ibn Ma'jah 3887, Ibn Sunni.)
