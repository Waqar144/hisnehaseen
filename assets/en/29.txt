1: He must raise his eyes towards the heaven and recite the following:

ar: أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ وَأَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ

"I bear witness that there is no God but Allah, the one, he has no partner. And I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger."

Tirmidhi has this supplication with these words added:

ar: اللَّهُمَّ اجْعَلْنِي مِنَ التَّوَّابِينَ وَاجْعَلْنِي مِنَ الْمُتَطَهِّرِينَ

"O Allah, cause me to be among those who repent and cause me to be among those who purify themselves."

ref: (Abu Dawood 169, 170, Nasa'i 148, Tirmidhi 55, Ibn Majah 470, Muslim 234 narrated by Uqbah R.A and Umar Ibn Khattab R.A)

2:

ar: سُبْحَانَكَ اللَّهُمَّ وَبِحَمْدِكَ أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ أَسْتَغْفِرُكَ وَأَتُوبُ إِلَيْكَ

"You are without blemish, O Allah, and with your praise, I bear witness that there is no God besides you. I seek your forgiveness and I repent to you."

ref: (Nasai Sunan-al-Kubra 9829, narrated by Abu Saeed al Khadri)
