The compiler confirms having heard from many Ulama that it is proved that supplication is approved between the words Allah and Allah and has memorized it. Hafiz Abdur Razzaq Rasghani has cited the explanation of Shaykh Ammad Maqdisi that supplication is approved at this point.

The word Allah is the ism al-Jallalah (the Glorious Name). It comes in quick succession in verse 124 of al-An'am:
ar: وَإِذَا جَآءَتْهُمْ ءَايَةٌۭ قَالُوا۟ لَن نُّؤْمِنَ حَتَّىٰ نُؤْتَىٰ مِثْلَ مَآ أُوتِىَ رُسُلُ ٱللَّهِ ۘ ٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ حَيْثُ يَجْعَلُ رِسَالَتَهُۥ ۗ سَيُصِيبُ ٱلَّذِينَ أَجْرَمُوا۟ صَغَارٌ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَعَذَابٌۭ شَدِيدٌۢ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَمْكُرُونَ ١٢٤

Whenever a sign comes to them, they say, “We will never believe until we receive what Allah’s messengers received.” Allah knows best where to place His message. The wicked will soon be overwhelmed by humiliation from Allah and a severe punishment for their evil plots.
— Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran

Pause after the ‘first occurrence of 'Allah', make a supplication and begin recital with the second (word) 'Allah', but the prayer must be brief and comprehensive so that the pause is not prolonged within a verse. Many people have experienced that prayers are accepted here.
