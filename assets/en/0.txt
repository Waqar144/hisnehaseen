1. Allah's Messenger ﷺ said, "Supplication is worship.” Then He recited the verse to the end of it."

ar:وَقَالَ رَبُّكُمُ ٱدْعُونِىٓ أَسْتَجِبْ لَكُمْ ۚ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِى سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَاخِرِينَ
[40:60]
Your Lord has proclaimed, “Call upon Me, I will respond to you. Surely those who are too proud to worship Me will enter Hell, fully humbled.”
— Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran

2. Allah's Messenger ﷺ said, "He among you for whom supplication is opened, the doors of acceptance (positive response) are opened for him."

According to another version,
    "The doors of paradise are opened for him." (Haakim)

Another,
    "The doors of mercy are opened for him. And nothing has been asked of Allah that is better in His sight than a prayer for security." (Tirmidhi)
---
3. Nothing but supplication averts decree and nothing but righteousness increases life.
---
4. To fear the decree is of no help while supplication is beneficial against the trial that has descended already and also against what has not yet descended. Indeed, when the trial descends, supplication encounters it (midway) and a fight ensues between them till the Last Day. Trial would try to come down and supplication would keep preventing it.

11.  If a Muslim raised his face towards Allah with a request then Allah surely fulfils his prayer by giving him in this world what he asks or holding his supplication as a treasure for him (in the Hereafter).
