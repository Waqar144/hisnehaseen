The honourable Ulama have said:
---
1: The place where one makes Zikr should be pure and clean and free from everything that might divert his attention.
---
2: One who makes Zikr must possess the qualities mentioned (under the Etiquette of supplication), like sincerity, etc.
---
3: His mouth must be completely clean and pure. If there is a bad odour in his mouth then he must remove it by using the Miswak.
---
4: He should sit facing the Qiblah.
---
5: He should display humility, helplessness, peace, dignity and attentive heart.
---
6: He must understand well the meaning of the Zikr he makes and must ponder over it.
---
7: If he does not know the meaning of the Zikr then he must learn it (from a scholar).
---
8: He must not make haste to increase the number. The Ulama have, therefore, suggested that in the Zikr لآ اِلَهَ اِلّا اللّهُ (Lailaha illallah) the La should be prolonged.
---
9: Whatever Zikr is known from the Prophet ﷺ whether Wajib or Mustahabb, it is not reliably made unless he utters it with his tongue in such a way that he himself hears it.
---
10: And, the most excellent Zikr is the great Qur'an except the words that the Holy Prophet ﷺ has taught us for special occasions. For instance, he has taught us سُبْحانَ رَبّيَ العَظِيم (My mighty Lord is without blemish), and in Sajdah سُبْحَانَ رَبِّيَ الأَعْلَى (So, we must recite these, and the Qur'an. Similarly, it is more excellent to make supplication during the rounds of tawaf than to recite the Qur'an.)
---
11: The excellence of Zikr of Allah is not tied down to tahleel (Lailaha illallah), tasbeeh (Subhan Allah), takbeer (Allahu Akbar). Rather, anyone who obeys Allah in any way (deed or speech) is one who makes Zikr and his action is a kind of Zikr.
---
12: The Ulama have said that if anyone observes the Zikr taught by the Prophet ﷺ for different situations and times, and he does that with regularity during day or night, then he will be regarded as one who makes much Zikr.
---
13: If anyone who has a wazifah that he practices regularly whether in Salah or in any other way which he misses any day then he must redeem it whenever it is possible for him. He must not omit it altogether.
