1: Sayyidina Jabir reported that the Prophet said, "when it is evening, the very initial stage of night, stop children from going out of the house because the devils spread out at this time. And, shut the doors after saying (Bismillah) and say Bismillah as you extinguish the lantern (before going to sleep), and say Bismillah as you tie the mouth of the water skin and say Bismillah as you cover the (uncovered) utensils and if you have nothing with which to cover them then place something over them crosswise.
(Bukhari 3280, Muslim 2012, Abu Dawud 2604)
