1:
ar: لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ، وَحْدَهُ لاَ شَرِيكَ لَهُ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ، وَهْوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ‏
"There is no God but Allah, who is Alone, who has no partner. To Him belongs the kingdom and to Him belongs all praise, and He is over all things powerful."

Recite this a hundred times.
(Bukhari 6403, Muslim 2691, Tirmidhi 3468, Nasa'i, Ibn Majah 3798, Ibn Abu Shaybah, as narrated by Abu Hurayrah.)

But it is stated in Musnad Ahmad that it should be recited two hundred times. (narrated by Ibn Umar)

2:
ar: سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ
"Allah is without blemish, and with His praise."
Recite it a hundred times.
(Bukhari 6405, Muslim 2691, Tirmidhi, Nasa'i, Ibn Abu Shaybah, as narrated by Abu Hurayrah)

3:
Allah's Messenger ﷺ said, "If anyone seeks refuge from the devil ten times during the day then Allah will appoint an angel for him and keep the devil away from him."
(Abu Ya'la, as narrated by Anas. Ref: Arabic(Dar at Taaseel): 4128, Arabic(Dar Al Mamoun): 7/146, Urdu 4100)

4: Allah's Messenger ﷺ said, "If anyone makes istighfar for believing men and believing women twenty-seven or twenty-five times every day then he is one of those whose supplication is granted and because of whom the earthlings get their provision."
One may opt for twenty-five or twenty-seven as he wills.
(Tabarani in Al-Kabeer, narrated by Abu Darda.)

5: The Prophet said once, "Can you not earn a thousand virtues every day? "The Sahabah said, "O Allah's Messenger how is that possible?" he said, "say
ar: سُبْحَانَ اللَّه
a hundred times and a thousand pious deeds will be recorded for that, or a thousand sins will be forgiven."

(This is what Muslim (2698) has but Tirmidhi (3463) and Nasa'i, have 'and' instead of ‘or’, so the credit is a thousand pious deeds and forgiveness of a thousand sins.)
(Narrator Sa'd Ibn Abi Waqqas.)
